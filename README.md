# MSBA622FinalProject
## Overview

This project analyzes the financial records of the fake PSU Hotel to detect potential fraud using Malloy. The dataset includes journal entries from 2014 to 2016 and a 2016 trial balance. The goal is to identify discrepancies, unusual transactions, and patterns indicative of fraudulent activity.

## Data Sources

je.csv: Contains journal entries from 2014–2016.

trailbalance.csv: Contains the 2016 trial balance with account balances.

Analytics_mindset_case_studies_PSU_Hotel_background.pdf: Background on PSU Hotel’s operations and financial context.

## Summary of Findings

What did we find? Well let me tell you! With **images**! Include at least 5 screenshots of visualizations!

## Background and Motivation

Financial fraud can be difficult to detect, but data analytics offers a powerful way to uncover hidden anomalies. By leveraging tools like Malloy, this analysis provides insights into PSU Hotel’s financial health, highlighting unusual transactions and discrepancies that could indicate fraudulent activity. This report is valuable for auditors, financial analysts, and anyone interested in forensic accounting and fraud detection.

## Code

This repository contains two Malloy code files:

- [`final_sources.malloy`](final_sources.malloy), sources all the data tables for the data analysis portion of this repository.
- [`final2.malloynb`](final2.malloynb), performs the analysis piece of the data provided by the Data Liberation Project.

## Why Malloy?
[Malloy](https://malloydata.dev) is an open source semantic data language, and a compelling alternative to pandas, ggplot, and SQL!
